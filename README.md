# Work-Day-Planner

## Description
9-5 work day planner powered by jQuery and Dayjs. The workday can be very hectic if it is not planned and organized. With this workday planner, you can easily plan your work day to maximize efficiency. With features such as color coordinated time boxes, local storage, and accurate dates, you are sure to increase productivity and efficiency. While building this page, I reinforced my knowledge of DOM traversal, jQuery, and local storage.
